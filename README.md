# FIFFIFT

Project to practice React and Next.js. This app implements the "rule" of 50-15-35 for personal finance and let's you track your spending in a simple and not rigid way.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
